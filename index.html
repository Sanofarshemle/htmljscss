<h3>2024 expansion<h3>
<p>In August 2023, at the 15th BRICS Summit, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that 6 emerging market group countries (Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) had been invited to join the bloc. Full membership was scheduled to take effect on 1 January 2024. However, the Argentine general election in November 2023 led to a change in president to Javier Milei, who had committed to withdraw the country's membership application. On 30 November 2023, incoming Foreign Minister of Argentina Diana Mondino confirmed that Argentina would not join the BRICS. On 29 December 2023 the Government of Argentina sent a letter to all BRICS leaders to officially announce its withdrawal from the application process.<p>

<p>Saudi Arabia did not join BRICS at the start of 2024 as had been planned, and they announced in mid-January that they were still considering the matter. As of April 2024, the matter is still under consideration. The organizers touted the expansion as part of a plan to build a competing multipolar world order that uses Global South countries to challenge and compete against the western-dominated world order that is led by western countries. China Daily used the expansion to claim that more developing countries were interested in joining BRICS. Despite this, Brazil and India have recently been building relations with western countries and have joined or applied to join competing western-led groups like OECD.<p>

<h4><b>Summit 2024<b><h4>
<p>The grouping has held annual summits since 2009, with member countries taking turns to host. Before South Africa's admission, two BRIC summits were held, in 2009 and 2010. The first five-member BRICS summit was held in 2011. The most recent BRICS leaders' summit took place virtually on 23 June 2022 hosted by China. India hosted the BRICS 2021 summit in New Delhi and, amid tensions with China, Chinese leader Xi Jinping had made a soft move by supporting India's Chairmanship in 2021.<p>
